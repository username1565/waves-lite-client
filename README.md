# waves-lite-client



This is **MODIFIED** [online web-wallet](https://waveswallet.io/) for [Waves](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waves/#markets) with [Waves DEX](https://waves.exchange/dex-demo) - **waves-lite-client**.

Original waves-lite-client, you can see [here, on this branch](https://github.com/username1565/waves-lite-client/tree/original-waves-lite-client), and [here, in releases](https://github.com/username1565/waves-lite-client/releases/tag/v0.5.18).

This is the main branch for this fork, and this is available, online - here: http://username1565.github.io/waves-lite-client/
I'm strongly recommend all to see the commits, and differences in the source code, before using this.

Online version of old waves-lite-client was been available here: https://waveswallet.io/

but this is [not supported now](https://github.com/wavesplatform/WavesGUI/issues/1415#issuecomment-504853747),
and there is the version [v0.5.22](https://waveswallet.io/js/waves-lite-client-mainnet-0.5.22.js) [in the scripts](https://github.com/wavesplatform/WavesGUI/issues/1415#issue-459681928), and now this is not working.

THIS IS JUST DEMO. DO NOT use the web-version from my github-page,

[because my GITHUB-account was been flagged within a week.](https://github.com/username1565/waves-lite-client/issues/2)

I strongly recommend to download zip-archive from releases, and using this locally, because this is client-side.

**If my GITHUB-account will be flagged again, then this DEMO, this repositary, this README.md,
and that issue will not be available for reading.**
